      <div class="physiology-info">
        <h3>1. Digestive System</h3>
        <p>Cattle have a unique digestive system that allows them to efficiently process fibrous plant material. They are ruminants, meaning they have a four-chambered stomach consisting of the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. This complex system enables them to break down cellulose from plants, which is essential for their nutrition.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rumen:</strong> The largest stomach chamber, where fermentation occurs.</li>
          <li><strong>Reticulum:</strong> Works closely with the rumen for further breakdown of food.</li>
          <li><strong>Omasum:</strong> Absorbs water and nutrients from the feed.</li>
          <li><strong>Abomasum:</strong> The true stomach, where digestion occurs with enzymes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Respiratory System</h3>
        <p>The respiratory system of cattle is designed to support their large body size and high metabolic rate. Cattle breathe through their nostrils, and the air passes through a series of structures, including the trachea and lungs, where oxygen is exchanged for carbon dioxide. Proper respiratory health is crucial for overall well-being.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Nostrils:</strong> The entry point for air.</li>
          <li><strong>Trachea:</strong> The windpipe that directs air to the lungs.</li>
          <li><strong>Lungs:</strong> The organs where gas exchange occurs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Circulatory System</h3>
        <p>The circulatory system in cattle is responsible for transporting blood, nutrients, and oxygen throughout the body. It consists of the heart, blood vessels, and blood. A healthy circulatory system is essential for maintaining energy levels and supporting growth and reproduction.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Heart:</strong> Pumps blood throughout the body.</li>
          <li><strong>Arteries:</strong> Carry oxygenated blood away from the heart.</li>
          <li><strong>Veins:</strong> Return deoxygenated blood back to the heart.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3> 4. Reproductive System</h3>
        <p>The reproductive system of cattle is crucial for breeding and maintaining herd numbers. Female cattle have a complex reproductive cycle, and understanding this cycle is essential for successful breeding management. The male reproductive system is also vital for ensuring successful mating and breeding outcomes.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Female Reproductive Cycle:</strong> A complex cycle involving estrus, ovulation, and fertilization.</li>
          <li><strong>Male Reproductive System:</strong> Produces sperm for fertilization.</li>
        </ul>
